    "- **Directional Representation**: Embedding vectors are particularly effective at representing directional relationships. To leverage this, special care is taken during the preprocessing stage to enforce scale consistency across different types of data.\n",
    "- **Fixed Dimensionality**: Each tag or token type (dates, numbers, currencies) is processed at a fixed height, facilitating uniformity that aids convolutional layers in detecting and learning patterns effectively.\n",
    "- **Data Types**: All numeric data is either floated or follows structured patterns, ensuring consistent handling during the embedding process.\n",

    "**Training Goals**\n",

This directional similarity should reflect the actual numerical closeness, enhancing the model's ability to interpret and utilize numerical data efectively.\n",
