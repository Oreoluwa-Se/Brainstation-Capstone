# Project Overview

---

## Problem Area

The reliance on traditional credit scoring systems poses significant barriers to financial inclusion, disproportionately affecting underserved populations without extensive credit histories.

---

## Proposed Data Science Solution

Our project proposes a data-driven solution that leverages **advanced predictive modeling techniques** to evaluate creditworthiness based on alternative data sources.

---

## Impact of the Solution

The implementation of this alternative credit scoring model promises to **broaden financial inclusion**, offering a more equitable opportunity for those currently underserved.

---

## Methodological Approach

- **Stage 0 Analysis**: Establish a baseline model performance using initial-stage data.
- **Incremental Data Integration**: Gradually incorporate data from Stages 1 and 2.
- **Adaptive Weighted Scoring**: Implement a dynamic scoring mechanism for the loss function.
