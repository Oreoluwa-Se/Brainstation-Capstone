# Loan Approval Predictor 🚀

Welcome to the Loan Approval Predictor! If you've ever wondered how financial institutions decide who gets a loan and who doesn't, you're in the right place. Here, we dive into the world of consumer finance, but with a twist—we’re making it smarter with data science!

## 🎯 The Problem

Ever tried to get a loan without a credit history? It’s like trying to get a job without work experience! Traditional systems often leave out young people or those who prefer using cash, deeming them "risky" due to insufficient data. Financial institutions use models known as "scorecards" to predict loan risk. However, these models need constant updates because just like fashion trends, clients' behaviors change frequently. 🔄

But here’s the catch: Updating these scorecards is time-consuming. A model that performs well today might become outdated tomorrow, leading to loans being issued to less ideal clients. Plus, any delay in spotting problems means potentially waiting until a loan goes unpaid. Not ideal, right? This is where our project steps in.

## 🌟 Proposed Solution

A Neural Network that doesn't just rely on traditional data, but enhances prediction with deeper financial records analysis. Imagine a system that learns from vast amounts of data and gets smarter over time—ensuring that loans are given not just based on past records but tailored to current realities.

## 📊 Dataset

We're working with a rich dataset from a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability/data). It includes various features and structures that help predict the stability and risk associated with issuing loans.
